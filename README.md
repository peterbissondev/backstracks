How To Write A Book:

Technically, the topic may seem insignificant, but to write a book and resulting site, if you have ever tried the idea of writing a book or developing a site with a lot of content, it's somewhat of a misconception that writing from page to page is continuous, to the final end of book or site.

From my experience, it's more about understanding the structure of a book and how quickly we might consider topics, two, three, four, five, at a time, which essentailly provide the bases of the content pages and chapters, all subject to change, from which our text evolves.

However, from a handheld World, which is mostly a phone, people who read off their phone, just scroll text paragraphs, through swipes, not provding much space for anything other than text paragraph,,, as in when reading... with larger editing and reading space, such as tablets, laptops, and even to large screens, features or reading views obviously change considerably.

The device range I'm targeting, are from the phone to desktop screens, with largers screen views, that would involve multipage application views.

The tesult of working with a single page view, book, would be site, for all devices, and to provide immediate edit and auto save and adding text regions (i.e.: heading, subheading, text, formatting according to book type ) tecknically, with all devices, has become about an experience of clickable page regions and how to deal with white-space or the text containing box, where there is no text, thus not a clickable region.

With practice, what makes sense as in what is expected by the end user, in reading mode, is the tap or click of a word, could be about the word itself, or a word range.
