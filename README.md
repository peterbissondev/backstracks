Continous Writer(CW) Web Application Development

How people do research and write their text can eventually equal the content of a book but how the content is sorted to reproduce the text, book like or site, for any media environment, examples are found through Microsoft's Visual Code and even Github Web and desk method but I find myself in need of an application which achieves a similar application at text and site structure.

With text, there are examples with phone applications, where texting provides quick referencing to next word options, an objective I am looking into but at the client or browser, through JavaScript and eventually with server-side support. jSon is the chosen transportable file format and structure where at the client I have tested in the past, text numeric referencing through JavaScript routine is fast enough for real time referencing and rewrties.

With text referencing, what I am also taking into account is the idea that the text can also be the content and index pages of the book or site structure and with a persistent jSon file format, numbers referencing words, at the server, regrouping, renumbering word referencing, meaning with jSon transformed and ready for the client book or site, at the server and client account it is one file reference, moving closer to machine level clusters, and how jSon words and numeric content are moved at high speed to the browser, yet with text and numeric references sorted with each rewrite, the original word collection and number reference is constantly updated, not the same, or changed.

Tests conducted on what many file fragments and indexing cost at any computer, give reason to database files, or no database but continous versioning of a book or site structure in real time, thus continous writer.

In the end, it appears as a simple editor except when doing research, how we fill in the gaps, betweem topics, also becomes a study.
