How To Write A Book:

Technically, the topic may seem insignificant, but to write a book and resulting site, if you have ever tried the idea of writing a book or developing a site with a lot of content, it's somewhat of a misconception that writing from page to page is continuous, to the final end of book or site.

From my experience, it's more about understanding the structure of a book and how quickly we might consider topics, two, three, four, five, at a time, which essentailly provide the bases of the content pages and chapters, all subject to change, from which are text will evvolve.

However, from a handheld World, which is mostly a phone, people who read off their phone, just scroll text paragraphs, through swipes, not provding much space for anything other than text paragraph,,, as in when reading... with larger editing and reading space, such as tablets, laptops, and even to large screens, features or reading views obviously change considerably.
