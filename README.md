With the idea of automating writing a book, I'm without a doubt, nowhere close to my complete objective, because I am also caught up in evaluating more technology methods than I have ever evaluated in the past.

So far, leading the pack, as far a methods are concerned, are line interpretation technologies and technologies which rely on arrays rather than memory pointers. (Line interpretation is fast and arrays reserve space and can be extemely fast.)

More on that as I move forward. Check the code and wiki.
