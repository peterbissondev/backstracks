    <h1>Writing An HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript Book At The Client</h1>

<i>Peter Bisson (rotedevs.com)</i>

<h2>Welcome,</h2>

<p>With the site providing immediate access to 1000 editable Web pages, writing a book is as simple as choosing the topics, and start writing.</p>

<p>For example, since the site is about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to start, I am subdividing the topics into five sections, including the lead pages, such as contents, book conventions, about the author, etc. and giving HTML about 200 pages, starting at page 50, CSS at page 250, JavaScript at 400, because it's a bigger topic, and Index pages at 800.</p>

<p>Since the book, is about client-side technology, at its base HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, also not advanced, but the index pages in a technology book usually play a considerable role, in helping the reader, research the topics.</p>

<p>Of course, a site is an automated environment, so that the objective is to keep an eye open about application flow, including how people will cross reference the content, at the site, and where applicable, on the Web.</p>

    <p>Prodcuing a client-side application which provides for one click web search (Bing only for now.) of the text, features three modes, including "Site Mode", "Edit Mode", and "Code Mode", and provides access to an editable 1000 pages, enough to produce either a fairly large site or write a book, that is what my hobby and work is about.</p>

    <p>Installing the application, as anyone might through localhost or Web server services, is pretty well straight up html, css, and javascript, check folders, as files have been uploaded without folders, but it is the practice with the application, that continues to change my perception of what is achievable through a technology, no matter the client-side interest, which is very preicise.</p>

    <p>More notes to come.</p>
